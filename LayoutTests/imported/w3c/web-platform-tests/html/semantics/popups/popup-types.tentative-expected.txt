FAIL If a popup=hint is shown, it should hide any other open popup=hint pop-ups, including ancestral pop-ups. (You can't nest popup=hint) hint1.showPopUp is not a function. (In 'hint1.showPopUp()', 'hint1.showPopUp' is undefined)
FAIL If a popup=auto is shown, it should hide any open popup=hint, including if the popup=hint is an ancestral pop-up of the popup=auto. (You can't nest a popup=auto inside a popup=hint) hint.showPopUp is not a function. (In 'hint.showPopUp()', 'hint.showPopUp' is undefined)
FAIL If you: a) show a popup=auto (call it D), then b) show a descendent popup=hint of D (call it T), then c) hide D, then T should be hidden. (A popup=hint can be nested inside a popup=auto) auto.showPopUp is not a function. (In 'auto.showPopUp()', 'auto.showPopUp' is undefined)
FAIL If you: a) show a popup=auto (call it D), then b) show a non-descendent popup=hint of D (call it T), then c) hide D, then T should be left showing. (Non-nested popup=hint can stay open when unrelated popup=autos are hidden) auto.showPopUp is not a function. (In 'auto.showPopUp()', 'auto.showPopUp' is undefined)
